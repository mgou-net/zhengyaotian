# Templates

Luminos is distributed with a simple [Boostrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) based template by default, but there are some other Open Source options that you can use to customize your own:

* [Foundation 3](http://foundation.zurb.com/)
* [960 Grid System](http://960.gs/)
* [HTML5 Boiler plate](http://html5boilerplate.com/)

Templates are stored into the ``templates`` subdirectory of your document root and follow the rules of the Go [html/template](http://golang.org/pkg/html/template/) package.

At the time of this writing, there is only one template into the ``templates`` subdirectory, ``index.tpl``.
